- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucyc-15. I am 23 and I am a data science apprentice.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, food, animals, and football!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and Python, but I'm sure there will be other programming languages in the future
- 💞️ I will mainly be using this as a space to share any SQL/Python projects that I am working/collaborating on throughout my apprenticeship and career.
